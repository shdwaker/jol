     * Because the underlying hardware platform often requires aligned accesses
     * to maintain the performance and correctness, it is expected the fields
     * are aligned by their size. For booleans it does not mean anything, but
     * for longs it's different. In this example, we can see the long field
     * is indeed aligned for 8 bytes, sometimes making the gap after the
     * object header.
